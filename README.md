test_raw_texts.txt - This file contains all the texts, used for testing.
Y.trn.txt - This file contains all the labels, used for training.
Y.tst.txt - This file contains all the labels, used for testing.
train.txt - An additional input file, which is used for clustering. For each datapoint, it contains the numbers of all relevant labels, followed by TFIDF-feature representations of the input text.
